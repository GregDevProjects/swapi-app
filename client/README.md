# SWAPI App - CLIENT

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

SWAPI App requires that you have Node.js and npm installed: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

You will also need the api running locally to be able to access data: https://github.com/GregDevProjects/swapi-app/blob/master/api/README.md

## Installing

```
npm install 
```

## Running the dev environment

```
npm start
```

## Running the tests

Sadly only the default test exists right now

```
npm run test
```
